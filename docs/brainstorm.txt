got png library working

got xmake build script working

got test runner munit working

goal
    read a simple image with only black and white colours
        //png lib
        traverse row pointers to find pixels
        learn how to interpret it's output

    access pixels  

        accessing pixel at (x, y)
        png_byte r, g, b;
        r = rows[y][x * 3 + 0];
        g = rows[y][x * 3 + 1];
        b = rows[y][x * 3 + 2];

        // png_set_filler(png_ptr, 0, PNG_FILLER_BEFORE);

    map a path element to it and write that to an SVG file (just XML)
        its just a string char*

        starts with a single letter and ends with a single letter

        each coordinate separated by a single letter

        string output

        learning XML
